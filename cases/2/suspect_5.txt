The daughter of Cheryl Williams and the granddaughter of Carol Bareis. From an early age, Sara knew that she wanted to be a doctor. However, after achieving her goal and earning a medical degree, Sara's career was jeopardized by her drug abuse problem. After countless relapses, Sara was finally able to get clean with the help of group therapy sessions. \n As one of the few doctors on staff, Sara is responsible for everything from administering physicals to performing emergency surgery. The job is a constant source of stress for her. Recently, after one of her patients died, she picked up drugs again. That, along with their vastly different political beliefs, has cooled her relationship with Cheryl Williams in recent years. \n She admitted that in an argument two days before the murder ccured, she threatened Cheryl Williams. However, Sara testified that she didnâ€™t kill Cheryl Williams or Carol Bareis. In fact, she stated that she was home that day.
