Gender: M
Age: 24
Race: Latino
Criminal Record: No
Lived with 2 roommates. Worked at a restaurant where he washed dishes. He had entered illegally into the U.S. after fleeing from his native Honduras when narcotics traffickers tried to force him to become a member of their gang. The bloody knife police found resembled the knives used at the restaurant where Aguirre-Jarquin worked. The head chef told police that one of the restaurant’s 10-inch chef’s knives was missing. Aguirre-Jarquin testified that he and his friends drank throughout the day and into the night, and that he returned to his home at 5 a.m. Because he was out of beer, he said, he walked next door. He then discovered Cheryl’s body. When there was no reply, he said, he went to Samantha’s room. Aguirre-Jarquin said he ran home, tossing the knife into the grass. Aguirre-Jarquin said he did not call police because he was an illegal immigrant and was afraid of being deported.
