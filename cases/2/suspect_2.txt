Neighbor of Cheryl Williams and Carol Bareis. \n Keyes' parents left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and became fundamentalist Christians and joined a white supremacist church. In the late 1990s the family relocated to Maupin, Oregon. They next moved to Vagabond Way in Altamonte Springs, Florida. \n Growing up, Keyes broke into neighbors' homes to steal guns, loved hunting, would pursue "anything with a heartbeat" and torture animals, behavior that has been linked to psychopathy. While in custody Keyes himself said, "I've known since I was 14 that … there were things that — that I thought were normal and that were OK that nobody else seemed to think were normal and OK." \n Israel Keyes is officially unemployed. Several Altamonte Springs citizens pointed out that he is a drug dealer. Furthermore, he is known for collecting and selling various kinds of knives. \n Israel Keyes testified that he has never visited Cheryl Williams’ and Carol Bareis’ home. He also claimed that on the night of the murder he saw a white lady of early thirties enter their house.
