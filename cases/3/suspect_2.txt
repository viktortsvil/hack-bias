One man, in police custody for an unrelated incident, testified that he was riding in a police vehicle when he saw the victim walking on the road and saw a truck similar to Barnes’ truck nearby. A Utica police officer said he saw a young man matching Barnes’ description parked alongside the street that night. Barnes’ brother-in-law testified that he saw a young woman getting into a truck along the road that was clearly not Barnes’ truck. Others said they saw Barnes at a local bowling alley through the evening of the murder. \n Barnes was questioned for 12 straight hours on September 21, three days after the victim was last seen. He said that he had driven to a bowling alley at 6 p.m. on the night of the crime and didn’t know anything about the murder. He was given a polygraph test – which investigators said was inconclusive – and police checked his truck for fingerprints and trace evidence.
